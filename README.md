# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

This website is a Work Day Scheduler.  The User is presented with a daily planner with the current date in the header with hourly time bocks.  The user can add and save notes into the timeblocks for appointments, meetings, "to-do's", etc. The hourly time blocks are color coded depending on whether that time block is in the past (gray), the present (red), or the future (green).  Events that are saved are saved into local storage and are available upon page reload/refresh.
